# FPGAodPoczatkuDoKonca 
In this repo I will post my private notes from reading a series of two articles from [elektronikab2b](https://elektronikab2b.pl/) website. They are written in my native language (Polish). 

## FPGA od początku do końca - część pierwsza
[Here](https://elektronikab2b.pl/technika/1315-fpga-od-poczatku-do-konca-czesc-pierwsza) is the link to the first article. Word "*pierwsza*" means *first*, "*od początku do końca*" means *from the beginning to the end*. So title in eng means *FPGA from the beginning to the end*. <br/>
An extension of the acronym *VHDL* is *Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language*. <br/>
To understand article, you need to learn how cells are connected in FPGA. Below is picture of the [LUT](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/169532/what-is-an-lut-in-fpga): <br/>

And imagine that our *FPGA* mainly consists of this type of logic elements. Inside you have a lot of these elements and they're connected together. We have many different types of connections between logic elements, such as *fuse*, *antifuse* or based on transistors. Type *fuse* and *antifuse* cannot be changed after programming, but connections created with transistors can be reprogrammed.

### FPGA can be divided according to the type of technology used to remember their configuration: 
#### Antifuse type 
This type of device allows us to only program them only once. It's an old technological type. <br/>
Device consists a lot of fuses inside which can only work after burnout (typically it's resistor 300 Ω). For this reason, the data in this type of FPGA can't be change. Due to their design, they are the safest systems. Almost all reverse engineering attempts to read the configuration of such a system are unsuccessful (it's virtually impossible). It should be noted, that by default the antifuse devices allow to read the saved configuration in order to test the correctness of the programming process, but after setting a special security bit, access to the internal configuration is blocked. Antifuse *FPGAs* are even more reliable than *ASICs*. <br/> 
The lack of internal transistors responsible for the configuration, makes these circuits much less susceptible (pol. *podatny*) to radiation damage. Thanks to it, this type of device is using in aeronautics or aviation where *FPGAs* based on *SRAM* or *Flash* memory will be too insecure. Also these types of devices are also still used by the military, due to high resistance to an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) from nuclear weapons. <br/>
*Antifuse* devices, due to the lack of configuration transistors, consume much less static power than the *SRAM* or *Flash* circuits manufactured in the same technology. This value is about 20% of the power consumed by the reprogrammable circuit. What's more, the lack of transistors also means no delays introduced by them, thanks to which the entire system is able to run much faster. <br/>
A very important advantage is that such devices are very durable (pol. *wytrzymałe*). The internal connectivity of antifuse components and networks is practically impossible to break without the destruction of the device, board or component. This makes devices highly reliable. <br/>
Big disadvantages of this system is high development costs and must (pol. *koniecznością*) to use a few steps less advanced technological process. Imagine situation when any errors are discovered... ;D <br/>
Thanks to this advantages of *antifuse FPGA* over other technologies are losing importance. 
 
#### SRAM type
This type of device is based on static memory technology, because of this lose their configuration after a power loss. Unlike (pol. *w odróżnieniu*) *antifuse* devices, these can be programmed multiple times. These deviecs don't require any additional technological processes, so these systems are designed based on the most advanced technologies. <br/>
Unfortunately, *SRAM* chips are volatile, so it's necessary to load the configuration code inside the chip every time when the system boots up. Configuration code is load from a special non-volatile memory chip such as EPROM or Flash. This additional requirement makes it necessary to reserve more space on the PCB surface. <br/>
In addition, the process of uploading the program takes some time, which delay the start of the device. These data can be easily read, which makes the project easy to decode and duplicate on other devices. 

#### Flash type
*Flash* device combine the advantages of *SRAM* and *antifuse* devices. <br/>
These devices remember the code, so there are no delays during startup. Their internal structure is less complicated than that *SRAM* devices, so they can be packed more densely (pol. *gęsto*). <br/>
Due to the production problems, these systems are usually several generations older than their counterparts (pol. *odpowiedniki*) produced at the same time, which only require the use of methods typical for *CMOS*. <br/>
Another disadvantage is the increased static power consumption, which is due to the pull-up resistors. 

### Logical structure 
To understand more from this part of the article, you need to know some defnitions. <br/>
First of all, what is **logic element** (for the manufacturer Altera) and **logic cell** (for the manufacturer Xilinx). They are sometimes called as *logic block* or **configurable logic block** (*CLB*). *Logic element* and *logic cell* is exactly the same, but they have different names due to the manufacturers. <br/>
They're a fundamental building block of *FPGA*, the *CLB* is duplicated hundreds or thousands of time. <br/>
A **logic cell** is basically a small lookup table (*LUT*), a *D flip-flop* and a *2-to-1 mux* (to bypass the flip-flop if desired). The *LUT* can implement any logic function. *Logic blocks* typically contain a few *logic-cells*. *LUT* has typically a few inputs, example below: <br/>

| Logic-cell (LUT) example |
| source: *https://breadboardgremlins.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/logic-cell.png?w=640 [03.05.2021]* |

As we can see above a typical cell consists of a 4-input *LUT*, a Full adder (FA) and a D-type flip-flop. In recent years, manufacturers have started moving to 6-input *LUTs* in their high performance parts (as in Intel Stratix devices). <br/>
Each *logic cell* can be connected to other *logic cells* through interconnect resources (wires/muxes placed around the logic cells). Each cell can do little, but with lots of them connected together, complex logic functions can be created. <br/>
To sum up, the *FPGA* devices consists of logical blocks, which are placed between the data buses that enable the appropriate connections between cells. Each cell has several inputs and a little bit fewer outputs. Typically, block consist of sixteen logical elements with between them carry signals, common clocks, and some control signals are transferred. <br/>
A typical *LUT* matrix can be converted to *16-bit RAM*, so it can be seen as additional memory - as long as it has no other logical function. Due to the way this memory is implemented, it is often referred as *distributed RAM*, to distinguish (pol. *rozróżnić*) it from typical built in memory blocks inside *FPGAs*. 

### LUT
*LUT* - lookup table (pol. *tablicowanie*) - in computer science is an array or data matrix that contains data structure created for the purpose of translating keys into values. Below we have example of simple two-dimensional (2D) lookup table: <br/>

As we can see it's simple array. In this case our input will be *Mass* and *Length* and output will be one value from table. Why are we using this? Imagine that we have very complicated mathematical formula and calculating the result can be very time consuming. So we can use the table where we put the results we calculated earlier this allow us to search the table for the appropriate input to find the result without computing. So imagine that in our case we have "*Mass*: 200" and "*Length*: 40", so the result is "8.6". Sometimes searching the table is much faster than calculating the result.

## FPGA od początku do końca - część druga
[Here](https://elektronikab2b.pl/technika/1468-fpga-od-poczatku-do-konca-czesc-druga) is a link to the second part of the article.

Sometimes we can find on the *FPGA* board additional hardware, to increase performance. It can be RAM blocks, subsystems that perform the most frequently performed operations (as [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation) blocks), hard cores or soft cores. location of the microcontroller outside the area where the logical cells are located - as shown in the figure below.

### Built-in hard cores
There are two options for placing hard cores on the FPGA board. <br/>
First is the location of the microcontroller outside the area where the logical cells are located - as shown in the figure below:
| ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116869973-fc2a8a80-ac11-11eb-9899-db0d3f656ef8.png) |

This can be made not only as a single silicon chip, but also as two or more integrated circuits connected to each other and closed in a single package. The separation of the classic part of FPGA from additional functions integrated in the same package makes it easier the use of programming tools. The designer's task is to assign the appropriate output ports in such a way that the desired signals are transferred between the microcontroller and the rest of the system. <br/>
Second option is placing the cores inside the main area of the FPGA, and for their operation as input and output use adjacent (pol. *sąsiadujący*) blocks of memory and logical cells. We can see idea of this in the picture below:

### Built-in soft cores
Another type of core is the one created by software. The synthesizable core modules are sold by many different companies, so a very frequent procedure is to buy licenses for already existing projects. Programmable cores can be customized according to the user's needs, which was not possible with hard cores. The designer can practically freely change the width of the data bus or the size and number of registers, and even implement any number of the same or different cores inside one FPGA. 

### Clock signal management
*Jitter* - instability of the edges of the clock signal, the deviation of a clock edge from its ideal position in time. Simply speaking, it is the inability of a clock source to produce a clock with clean edges. So the parameters of the clock signal are very important for the efficiency/correctness of the entire system. To avoid jitter inside FPGA clock lines are designed in a tree-like manner (pol. *w sposób podobny do drzewa*), to minimize possible clock delays that can occur. <br/>
Due to the possibility of implementing functionally separate logical units inside one system, as well to enable the reduction of energy consumption, producers created *clock domains* - areas clocked with the different clock. This allows the clock signal to be turned off for a small group of cells in the system, so the current consumed by all device is lower. In addition, every *clock domain* can operate at different frequencies, thanks to this, one *clock domain* can work with different clock than other in the same time. <br/>
The clock signal can be input through any of the pins of the circuit, but in order to ensure its optimal work, you should use the designated ports for this.

### Input/output systems 
Another important parameter of programmable deices are the input/output ports. FPGA input and output ports were divided into blocks. Each block can work with a different voltage, so there is no need to use pull-up resistors on the PCB to communicate with devices working in different standards. <br/>
Another part of the input/output devices are special serial interfaces designed to transmit a differential signal (pol. *sygnał różnicowy*). 

### Manufacturers' offer
In addition to the previously described program blocks (as built-in soft cores), which are entire microcontrollers or microprocessors, it is possible to use various types of smaller functional blocks. These blocks are available in two forms:
1. As *soft IP* version - written in hardware description languages such as VHDL or Verilog. These modules can be implemented in devices of any company.
2. As *firm IP* version - modules that have already been adapted to a specific family of FPGAs. These blocks contain a description of the connections and cell configurations of a given programmable device and their field of application is limited.
