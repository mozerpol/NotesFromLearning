Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed default values for unconnected tkeep and tstrb inputs for AXI stream VCs to match the standard:

  - tkeep changed from all zeros to all ones
  - tstrb changed from all zeros to value of tkeep

  May affect existing code if these values are verified by the testbench despite being unconnected. (:vunit_issue:`1049`)


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Changed AXI stream slave to only verify tdata if both of tkeep and tstrb are set. Removed potential race condition an AXI stream master. (:vunit_issue:`1049`)
