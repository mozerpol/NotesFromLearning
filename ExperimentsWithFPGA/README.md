## ExperimentsWithFPGA
_______________

In this repo I'll post my private notes from reading the series of articles
that appeared in the *Elektronika Praktyczna* magazine. <br/>
It was a series of 21 [?] articles, the first article appeared in the
issue 12.2019 <br/>
The articles were written in my mother language (Polish). You can buy all
numbers directly from the producer:
https://ulubionykiosk.pl/archiwum/elektronika-praktyczna [27.04.2021]. <br/>
On the internet you can find legally shared articles (perhaps not every article
was shared). Just search in google "elektronika praktyczna eksperymenty z fpga",
example of second article: https://ep.com.pl/kursy/13584-eksperymenty-z-fpga-2
<br/>

Below I will describe how to start the first project with Quartus and upload
project to FPGA. This will be additional info, for my convenience, but maybe,
it'll useful for someone in the future :) <br/>

### How run Quartus
I'm linux user (Debian buster 4.19), so everything will be shown on linux. I
used **Quartus Prime Version 20.1.0 Build 711 06/05/2020 SJ Lite Edition**,
*Patches Installed: None*. ~~Unfortunately I will not show (maybe later) how to
install Quartus with all drivers, but I remember that I had very very big
problem with it :D~~ Update 13.07.2021: I was forced to reinstall my system, so
also I install once again Quartus with drivers for *T-core* (inside I have a
MAX10). I found nice tutor how to install everything: <br/>
https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/sites/eecs.oregonstate.edu/files/tekbots/docs/ece272/de10-lite-quartus.pdf <br/>
I remember that some time ago, durng installation, I had an error, which hasn't
occured now, I don't know why. <br/>
So in first step from terminal in **superuser mode** we're going to destination
where we installed Quartus: <br/>
`/home/mozerpol/Documents/nauka/quartus/quartus/bin` <br/>
In *bin* folder we should find a file called "quartus", only quartus, not
quartus_asm or quartus_sh. When we find this file we can run it: <br/>
`root@mozerpol-pc:/home/mozerpol/Documents/nauka/quartus/quartus/bin# ./quartus`
and press *enter* <br/>

### First project in Quartus
I learned Verilog, so I will show on this. After running the program, we should
see main window: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116442136-704fe180-a852-11eb-9879-5698bf49f210.png)

In the upper right corner click *File* -> *New Project Wizard...*. After whis
we will see:
1. <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116383619-4927ee80-a817-11eb-992a-ba1c37493f1a.png)
2. In the first form select directory for project in the second form write name
for project <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116384518-35c95300-a818-11eb-9d90-e7bb362fb77e.png)
3. In the next step *Project Type* select option *Empty Project* and click
*Next*.
4. In the next step we have *Add Files* window. We (or I ;p) don't want add
files to projesc, so just click *Next*.
5. Step *Family, Device & Board Settings*. In this stage we must select
matchable device. <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116385280-ef282880-a818-11eb-80c1-1c304f8ac655.png)
We are setting everything in tab *Device*. In part *Avalible devices* find your
device and select it. How to know, which exactly FPGA is in your board? Just
look at board and find FPGA. Below we have example photo from internet. <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116386942-935e9f00-a81a-11eb-8a82-d5cf2c628b0d.png)
<br/> Thanks to numbers which are on FPGA, we know that it is *MAX 10* family,
device *10M50DAF484C6GES*. <br/>
Select it (not exactly that, but your device that you have on your own board,
it's example ;p) <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116388009-b2a9fc00-a81b-11eb-8d85-4bb95fb2ef0c.png)
6. In the next step *EDA Tool Settings* select everywhere *<None>*.
7. Last window in our configuration is *Summary*.
8. Now our main window looks like: <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116389086-db7ec100-a81c-11eb-907b-888077490e4f.png)
9. Now it's time to add verilog file. To do this, click *File* -> *New...*,
after this you'll see something like this: <br/> ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116430487-2d3c4100-a847-11eb-9c78-c518dabbb872.png) <br/>
Click on *Verilog HDL File*
10. Now, you should see empty page, where we can write some code. Just copy and
paste below code (will turn on some LEDs on my board):
```verilog
module quartusFirstTest(
    output a,
    output b,
    output c
);

assign a = 1'b0;
assign b = 1'b1;
assign c = 1'b1;

endmodule
```

11. Save project by *ctrl + s*. It's very important filename and name after word
`module` in our code must be the same as project name. So, if our project is
called *quartusFirstTest*, then verilog file must be called *quartusFirstTest.v*
and module in our code. Of course not every file or module must be called in
this way :D. Only one file and one module.
12. The next step: click on the icon *Start Compilation* or press *Ctrl + L*.
Below is the picture, with icon which you should click: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116433590-f0257e00-a849-11eb-9dde-347f181e585e.png) <br/>
This start compilation. On the left side you should see bars with progress and
bottom with messages like warnings or errors.
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116432967-58c02b00-a849-11eb-96d8-e426a4ea881b.png)
13. Now click on the *Pin Planner* or press *Ctrl + Shift + N*, Below is the
picture, with icon which you should click: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116435464-aa69b500-a84b-11eb-9b28-3e78ae14c10f.png)
14. In next step we must assign output pins from FPGA to our variables
(variables from the code). To do this select from *Location* part (table on the
bottom) the correct pins: <br/>
![aaaaa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116443770-56af9980-a854-11eb-9406-316232d1bdee.png) <br/>
Ok, but how to know which output pins assign to our variables? It's easy, from
datasheet our board. I'm using T-Core dev board, inside you can find info which
pin on our board was connected to LED: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116444162-bb6af400-a854-11eb-9e5a-d7431ac0c8db.png)
Thanks to this picture we ca notice that LEDs were connected to pin: *PIN_AA14*,
*PIN_AA15*, *PIN_AA16* and *PIN_AA17*. It's very important. In datasheet we have
double *PIN_AA15*, but it's mistake, should be *PIN_AA17* instead *PIN_AA15*.
15. Now you must once again compile our project, so just repeat steps from point
*12*.
16. Connect board to computer.
17. Double click on *Program Device*: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116445346-18b37500-a856-11eb-9fbf-3f65570d53e8.png)
18. On  the left side you have *Add File...*, click on it. After this navigate
to *output_files* -> click on *projectName.sof*. Then click on *Open*: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116445688-71830d80-a856-11eb-9582-6cfa82747312.png)
19. Click on *Hardware Setup...* (left upper corner) -> from *Currently selected
hardware* select your board: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/116446227-05ed7000-a857-11eb-80f8-03fe0b59aa98.png)
20. Click *Start* (left upper corner), now the code will be upload to our board.
21. In right upper corner you have status bar. Green bar with word *100%
(Successful)* means that our code is inside our board.
22. I'm happy, because it works for me ;p <br/>

### More details about MAX 10
Below I will explain some of the features from the datasheet that seem important. <br/>

**TSMC** - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - is a Taiwanese
manufacturing and design company. It is one of Taiwan's largest companies.

**LUT** was described [here](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/FPGAodPoczatkuDoKonca#lut). <br/>
**PLL** was described [here](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/FPGAodPoczatkuDoKonca#pll). <br/>
**LE** - was described [here](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/FPGAodPoczatkuDoKonca#logical-structure). <br/>
Bro remember, *LUT* is part of *LE*.

**M9K** - is a synchronous memory block. We can say (it'll be more precisely),
that embedded memory structure consists of *M9K* memory blocks columns. The
*M9K* block is useful for storing processor code, implementing lookup schemes,
and implementing large memory applications. Each block contains 9,216
programmable bits, including parity bits, capable of operating at up to 284 MHz.
You can configure the *M9K* block as true dual-port, dual-port, single-port RAM,
RAM, FIFO buffers, or ROM. More about *M9K*
[here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/quartushelp/17.0/reference/glossary/def_m9k.htm).

**True dual-port** - it's the ability of some circuit to read and write
simultaneously. So for example, if we have a RAM cell to which we can
simultaneously write and read some data, we can say that this cell is *true
dual-port* capability. Or we can read simultaneously two different datas or
write two different datas in the same time. <br/>
Typically, this feature is discussed in the context of memory. To understand
this better, we need to say more about memories. <br/>
Memories classification: <br/>
| ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/117035618-d205c500-ad04-11eb-9eba-d451a9ba9526.png) |

The **difference between single port RAM and dual port RAM** is that single port
RAM can be accessed at one address at one time, thus you can read/write only one
memory cell during each clock cycle. Dual port RAM has ability to simultaneously
read and write different memory cells at different addresses. Single port uses a
6 transistor basic RAM cell, while the dual port RAM cell uses 8 transistor cell
for memory. <br/>
Sum up, a dual-port memory has two independent access ports to a common storage
array. Some dual-port memories can use one port only for write, the other one
only for read but better designs have no such restriction, they allow read or
write on both ports.

**Successive-approximation ADC** - *SAR* - is a type of analog-to-digital
converter that converts a continuous analog waveform into a discrete digital
representation using a binary search (pol. *wyszukiwania binarnego*) through all
possible quantization levels before finally result a digital output for each
conversion. More about it on
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive-approximation_ADC).

**JTAG** - *Joint Test Action Group* - s an industry standard (IEEE 1149.1) for
verifying designs and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture. If we
want use *JTAG* for testing or programming, integrated circuits placed in the
tested system must have an appropriate hardware layer of this interface inside.
One of the most important feature of the *JTAG* standard is the ability to
program the circuit in a ready device without disconnecting it (it's called
*In-System Programming*, *ISP* for short). JTAG works on the principle  (pol.
*działa na zasadzie*) of a 16-state
[deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).
It is possible to program several systems at the same time - then we must
connect devices in a series. <br/>
JTAG signal lines are:
- TDI - Test Data In – data input,
- TDO - Test Data Out – data output,
- TCK - Test Clock – clock signal input,
- TMS - Test Mode Select – operating mode selection,
- TRST - Test Reset – reset (optional).

**Vertical migration support** - is a *Quartus II* software feature that allows
a design to be able to migrate to all supported migration path devices in the
same package. You should refer to the Quartus II software Pin Migration window
in the Pin Planner to see the pin migration results for all devices in the
migration path.

**Logic Elements and Logic Array Blocks** <br/>
The *LAB* (logic array block) consists of 16 logic elements (*LE*) and a
*LAB*-wide control block. An *LE* is the smallest unit of logic in the Intel MAX
10 device architecture. Each *LE* has four inputs, a four-input *look-up table*
(LUT), a register, and output logic. The four-input *LUT* is a function
generator that can implement any function with four variables. Picture of it,
below: <br/>
![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/117125541-f2cc2a00-ad99-11eb-890e-a1a396baa570.png)

**User Flash Memory** - *UFM* - this block in Intel MAX 10 devices stores
non-volatile information. <br/>
**Avalon Memory-Mapped Interface** - *Avalon-MM* - mapping I/O interface in
address space. *Avalon* is Intel interface family, which can help connect
components suitable for streaming high-speed data, reading and writing registers
and memory, and controlling off-chip devices. We have *Avalon* components such
as:
- Avalon Streaming Interface (Avalon-ST) — an interface that supports the
    unidirectional flow of data, including multiplexed streams, packets, and DSP
    data.
- Avalon Memory Mapped Interface (Avalon-MM) — an address-based read/write
    interface typical of master–slave connections.
- Avalon Conduit Interface — an interface type that accommodates individual
    signals or groups of signals that do not fit into any of the other Avalon
    types. You can connect conduit (pol. *przewód*) interfaces inside a Platform
    Designer system. Alternatively, you can export them to connect to other
    modules in the design or to FPGA pins.
- Avalon Interrupt Interface — an interface that allows components to signal
    events to other components.
- And much more.
More about Avalon is in
