## Eksperymenty z FPGA (6)
*Elektronika Praktyczna* Nr 5 (328) â€¢ 05.2020
This issue is about *UART* - *Universal Asynchronous Receiver* and *PWM*. At the
beginning I focused on UART. PWM I'll describe later. I is transmitter in 
previous repo, 
[here](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/master/ExperimentsWithFPGA/4).

As before I divided this issue into two parts. The first is about library from
*EP*, next is my own library.
