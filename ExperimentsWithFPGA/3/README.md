The first part is about button debouncing. To eliminate this the author suggest
device based on following scheme: <br/>

To understand this the first step is explain how *D flip-flow* works. <br/>
In short it performs the function of rewriting information from input *D* to
output *Q* with a delay of one clock pulse, hence its name *D* (like delay) 
flip-flop. <br>
The implementation in Verilof for *dff* is inside dff.v file with its test
bench. The output waveform: <br/>
