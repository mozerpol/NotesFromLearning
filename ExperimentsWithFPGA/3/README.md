The first part is about button debouncing. To eliminate this the author suggest
device based on following scheme: <br/>

To understand this the first step is explain how *D flip-flow* works. <br/>
In short it performs the function of rewriting information from input *D* to
output *Q* with a delay of one clock pulse, hence its name *D* (like delay) 
flip-flop or *D-latch*. <br>
*D* flip-flop has two inputs, a *clock* (CLK) a *data* (D) and two outputs. One
is main output represented by *Q* and the other is negation of *Q* represented 
by *Q’*. The symbol of a *D* flip-flop is shown below: <br/>

A *D* flip-flop is constructed by modifying an SR flip-flop.

The implementation in Verilog for *dff* is inside dff.v file with its test
bench. The output waveform: <br/>

Another waveform: <br/>

As we can see the output (*Q*) can change only when we have a clock rising edge. 
Otherwise last result is latched. Now it's easy create truth table: <br/>
|*D*|*clk*|*Q*|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|0|0|last state|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|last state|
|1|1|1|

The most important application of *D* flip-flop is frequency Division circuit.
The *Q’* output is connected to the *D* input as a closed feedback loop.

The next thing to understand main topic in this issue is *XOR* gate. As a 
reminder I put the truth table and symbol: <br/>

So the result for this part: <br/>

is simple truth table from *XOR* gate (0110). So we can summarize this part, when 
the input for *D* will be stable, then output (*Q*) from *d-latch* will be the 
same as input. It means that on input *XOR* we have the same values. Thanks to
this we can obtain two the same states: *0* and *0*. <br/>
Changing the input state for *d-latch* will cause that on the output of *XOR* we
have *1*. The state *1* reset our counter: <br/>
