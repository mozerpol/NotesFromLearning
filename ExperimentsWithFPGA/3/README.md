The first part is about **button debouncing**. To eliminate this the author
suggest device based on following scheme: <br/>

To understand this the first step is explain how *D flip-flow* works. <br/>
In short it performs the function of rewriting information from input *D* to
output *Q* with a delay of one clock pulse, hence its name *D* (like delay) 
flip-flop or *D-latch*. <br>
*D* flip-flop has two inputs, a *clock* (CLK) a *data* (D) and two outputs. One
is main output represented by *Q* and the other is negation of *Q* represented 
by *Q’*. The symbol of a *D* flip-flop is shown below: <br/>

A *D* flip-flop is constructed by modifying an SR flip-flop.

The implementation in Verilog for *dff* is inside dff.v file with its test
bench. The output waveform: <br/>

Another waveform: <br/>

As we can see the output (*Q*) can change only when we have a clock rising edge. 
Otherwise last result is latched. Now it's easy create truth table: <br/>
|*D*|*clk*|*Q*|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|0|0|last state|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|last state|
|1|1|1|

The most important application of *D* flip-flop is frequency Division circuit.
The *Q’* output is connected to the *D* input as a closed feedback loop.

The next thing to understand main topic in this issue is *XOR* gate. As a 
reminder I put the truth table and symbol: <br/>

| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134187454-a88b3f17-89a9-4011-9dc3-f747d2676be1.png) |

So the result for this part: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134188780-ff4bc2f5-b3a3-4239-b941-ff149e086b04.png)

is simple truth table from *XOR* gate (0110). So we can summarize this part, when 
the input for *D* will be stable, then output (*Q*) from *d-latch* will be the 
same as input. It means that on input *XOR* we have the same values. Thanks to
this we can obtain two the same states: *0* and *0*. <br/>
Changing the input state for *d-latch* will cause that on the output from *XOR* 
we have *1*. The state *1* reset our counter: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134194431-0222b806-297c-49c4-929d-b0cdadfc51aa.png)

Otherwise (in case when from *XOR* output we have *0*) the counter will count 
up. <br/>
The next part our circuit: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134318761-a899369e-977d-4844-91fe-91f110ac6a3c.png)

is responsible for counting when we have a stable state. I mean, if input to our
device is in the same state, then output from *XOR* is equal *0*. Then above 
marked part can count up. *SR* input it's a additional input to our counter, 
which can *reset*. <br/>
```SystemVerilog
always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst)
	if (!rst)
		stable_time <= '0;
	else if (sr)
		stable_time <= '0;
	else
		stable_time <= stable_time + 1;
```

As we can see that counter will count when:
- *rst* (it's our *SR* input) must be equal *0*, because `if(!rst)` then reset
	counter.
- *sr* - it's additional input in couter, which need logic *1* to reset counter
	`else if (sr)`

`stable_time` is a register which store current value. How it works? <br/>
`stable_time` is a register of some length. For example it can be 
`[3:0]stable_time`, so it's four bits register. At the beginning we have: <br/>
*stable_time* == 0000 <br/>
When we increment value (`stable_time <= stable_time + 1;`), then we have" <br/>
*stable_time* == 0001 <br/>
When we increment once again, then we have: <br/>
*stable_time* == 0010 <br/>
Once again... <br/>
*stable_time* = 0011 <br/>
As you can see every clock cycle we increment counter, due to four bits we have
2^4 different possibilities. <br/>
Assume one clock takes 1 second, so if we want up to the end of counter we need
2^4 seconds.  <br/>
Initialization (zero time):<br/>
0000 <br/>
The first clock cycle (1st sec): <br/>
0001 <br/>
The second clock cycle (2nd sec): <br/>
0010 <br/>
The third clock cycle (3rd sec): <br/>
0011 <br/>

As you can see it's also easy to create simple delay block, you must know only
timing of your clock.

The next part of our debouncing device is also *D-latch*: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134329124-06b38f28-b73c-4bcd-9d77-67837a355c51.png)

Operation of this module is very easy. *CE* means *clock enable* and it's the
last one bit in *stable_time* register: `stable_time[N-1]`. So when the counter
cout to the end, then will turn on the last *d* flip-flop and this flip-flop
set on output high state. <br/> In my opinion we can get rid the last one 
flip-flop, but maybe entire device is more relaiable.

The next part in this issue is about edge detector. The scheme for it: <br/>
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134339227-1cb0c676-393f-40bf-bf65-2bc5a4f5dda2.png) |
|:--:|
| *Edge detector scheme* |
| Source: *Elektronika Praktyczna 03.2020, p. 126* |

After detecting a rising edge *edge detector* will set on its output logic one,
which lasts for one period of clock cycle. <br/>
The operation of this circuit is simple. If input for first *d-latch* is stable,
then on the output we have logic one. After this, *1* goes to negated *AND* 
entry and we have logic *0*. <br/>
The waveform from the output of edge detector: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134383503-5ea324e3-ec1f-401d-acbb-75f9d50fcb97.png)

The next part in this issue is **shift register**. <br/>
As we know, we can use the *D* flip-flop as a one clock tick delay. If we
connect the inputs and outputs of several flip-flops (in our module we have N
number), we get a shift register. The signal on the last one will be delayed by
N. <br/>

| *Shift register scheme* |
| Source: *Elektronika Praktyczna 03.2020, p. 126* |

Very intresting is part: <br/>
```SystemVerilog
for (int i = 1; i < N; i++)
	q[i] <= q[i-1];
```

It won't be done iteratively, but will create a lot of blocks, which will work
simultaneously. I think is not important explain the rest part of article,
because it's based on the previous informations from this text.

In this part we'll **bring together** all smaller parts. The name for this part
will be "shift_reg_led" and it's a shift register, which can be controlled
by switches. <br/>
If I want to recreate the work it'll be helpful: <br/>
![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134549466-75c9da57-b13a-451d-b695-5a8c20d9c6b1.png)

The next experiment is implementation library for encoder. <br/>
I'm using the encoder module, like this: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134562519-5f93b082-719d-4204-8dca-c660f7544dd1.png)

As you can see it has five pins. Encoder allows detect direction of rotation and
the quantity of rotations. Encoder has five pins: <br/>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134662597-25a6b7ea-c455-458d-8a3f-f74f3173a1ed.png)

In my project I'm using *clk*, *dt*, *+*, *gnd*. This pins we must connect as
shown in the picture above. <br/>
During rotation on the output on *A* and *B* output appear rectangular waveform,
which are out of phase (pl. *przesunięte w fazie*) with each other by 90 degrees.
The measurement resolution is determined by the number of pulses per one axis 
revolution. Example of this waveform is below: <br/>
| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/134663438-8f1de6a6-a2b3-46fa-8b76-82612716f29b.png) |

The easiest way to interpretet it is use *A* as clock signal and *B* as 
information about direction. Then in every rising edge on *A* we can change 
value inside our counter: 
- if on *B* we have high state, then we increment our counter
- if on *B* we have low state, then we decrement our counter

If we sum this informations we conclude that we must create bidirectional 
counter.

| *Scheme a bidirectional counter* |

It's very similar to previous counters, but it has additional input - *dir*. 
Below is part of code, which counter: <br/>
```Verilog
always@(posedge clk or negedge rst)
   if (!rst)
     q_reg <= {8{1'b0}};
 else if (ce)
   q_reg <= q + ((dir) ? 1'b1 : -1'b1);
```
