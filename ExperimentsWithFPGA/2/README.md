To understand this issue I must explain a few things. <br/>
The first is 8421 code. <br/>
Exactly we should say *BCD* (binary coded decimal) with a weight of 8421.
To avoid confusion, code 8421 is sometimes referred as NBCD (Natural BCD),
where each decimal digit is represented by its corresponding four-bit binary 
value, as shown below: <br/>

The next thing is binary counter. It's a device that counts clock pulses. It has
a clock input and outputs where we have the counter state, i.e. the number of 
clock pulses counted, appears in binary code 8421.
