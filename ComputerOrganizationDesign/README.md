### 1.2 Eight Great Ideas in Computer Architecture <a name="12"></a>

**systems software** - Software that provides services that are commonly useful,
including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers.

**operating system** - Supervising program that manages the resources of a
computer for the benefit of the programs that run on that computer.

**compiler** - A program that translates high-level language statements into
assembly language statements.

**binary digit** - Also called a bit. One of the two numbers in base 2 (0 or 1)
that are the components of information.

**instruction** - A command that computer hardware understands and obeys.

**assembler** - A program that translates a symbolic version of instructions into
the binary version.

**assembly language** A symbolic representation of machine instructions.

**machine language** - A binary representation of machine instructions.

**high-level programming language** - A portable language such as C, C++, Java,
or Visual Basic that is composed of words and algebraic notation that can be
translated by a compiler into assembly language.

### 1.4 Under the Covers <a name="14"></a>
**It is a super important:**
the hardware in any computer performs the same basic functions: inputting data,
outputting data, processing data, and storing data.

**input device** - A mechanism through which the computer is fed information,
such as a keyboard.

**output device** - A mechanism that conveys the result of a computation to a
user, such as a display, or to another computer.

The five classic components of a computer are input, output, memory, datapath,
and control, with the last two sometimes combined and called the processor.
The datapath performs the arithmetic operations, and control tells the datapath,
memory, and I/O devices what to do according to the wishes of the instructions
of the program.
