# Nios V getting started

## 1. Software used:
- Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) x86_64
- Tested on: Cyclone IV / MAX 10
- Quartus: Prime 23.1 standard
- Ashling RiscFree: v23.4.1, 3rd Nov 2023
- Debuger: OpenOCD

Location of the necessary tools (I am providing them because I assume they are
not in $PATH):
- OpenOCD: ~/Quartus/qprogrammer/linux64/openocd
- Ashling RiscFree: ~/Quartus/riscfree/RiscFree/RiscFree
- juart-terminal: ~/Quartus/qprogrammer/linux64/juart-terminal
- niosv-bsp: ~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-bsp
- niosv-app: ~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-app
- niosv-shell: ~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-shell

## 2. Possible problems
1. To get the latest version of code executed by Nios V, you need to load the
sof file into the FPGA every time, then compile the Nios V project in RiscFree
and upload it to Nios V.
2. After loading a fresh sof into the FPGA, debugging only works on the first
run. In the next runs, Ashling RiscFree returns the error:
```
Operation failed:
Command aborted.", and GDB: "Warning: Cannot insert breakpoint 1. Cannot access
memory at address 0x2cc".
```
This is probably because GDB has detected `Memory access -> System bus (Data
width : 128 Address size : 25)` as the way to access memory. This does not
happen on the first run, and additionally width + address are incorrect and
their values ​​change between runs. The same happens when trying to run from the
CLI.

The solution to these problems is to use OpenOCD.

## 3. Hello world
### 3.1. Quartus part
Create a new Nios V project in Quartus:
1. *File* → *New Project Wizard* → ...
Remember the project name, because you will need to enter it later in Platform
Designer.
2. Open Platform Designer and create a sample Nios V project:

Nios V Settings:

Memory settings (memory size must be greater than XXX, I don't remember how
much, large enough):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29164ed4-f43b-4407-8ad6-d34eff0a6285)

Jtag settings: no changes

3. Assign addresses: *System* → *Assign Base Addresses*.
4. Save the Platform Designer project with the same name as the saved Quartus
project.
5. Click *Generate HDL* (bottom right corner), it will generate with warnings,
but that's OK.
6. Click *Finish*.
7. Add the Platform Designer generated file *name*.qip (should be in *name_from_platform_designer/synthesis/name.qpip*). Go to *Files* tab, right
click *Add/Remove Files* in *Project*:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2a9b455-a930-4a5c-b3ce-cbbbeaa69a2d)

8. Start synthesis and assign clk to the appropriate pin in Pin Planner.
9. Compile everything.
10. Upload sof to FPGA.

### 3.2. niosv-shell part
1. Open the terminal and go to the project directory (where the file with the
*sopcinfo* extension is, i.e. where the Quartus project is). Run Nios command
shell:
- `~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-shell`
2. Generate a bsp configuration file for the project. The location where the
file will be created is important, i.e. *./software/bsp/*:
- `~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-bsp -c -t=hal --sopcinfo=niosv.sopcinfo ./software/bsp/settings.bsp`
After executing this command, it should look something like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a6b8d0-5e01-4705-be68-d45d78069c7a)

3. Go to the *./software/* directory (where the bsp folder was automatically
created in the previous step) and create an app directory, and inside it an
empty file *hello.c*. It should look something like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aaa93df-2e6b-43c4-a7c3-9af28112030c)

4. Generate a configuration file for Cmake (in the terminal where nios-shell
is):
- `~/Quartus/niosv/bin/niosv-app -a=./software/app -b=./software/bsp -s=./software/app/hello.c`
Every time something is changed in Platform Designer, you have to repeat steps 8
and 9.

### 3.3. Ashling RiscFree part
1. Start Ashling RiscFree, in a new instance of the terminal (it can be a new
tab, nios-shell is in a separate one):
- `~/Quartus/riscfree/RiscFree/RiscFree` <br/>
2. After the program opens, click *Create a project*.
2. Expand *C/C++* and select the *C Project* option. *Next*.
3. Project name: app, location for the project is folder: *./software/app/*.
Project type: expand Cmake driven and select options: Empty Project. It should
look something like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c63b750-052e-4e88-bdcd-a0d68cf9506b)

Click *Next* and select all options:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd2efd72-9aa7-4f09-a37b-642439c3eace)

4. *Finish*.
5. Open the previously created *hello.c* file (expand the *app* folder and open
*hello.c*), add sample code:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello\n");
   return 0;
}
```
6. Save.
7. Right click on the project: *app* → *Build Project*.
8. Generate a configuration file from the terminal (where nios-shell is running)
for OpenOCD *debugger.cfg* and place it in the */software/app/* folder (where
the *hello.c* file is):
- `~/Quartus/qprogrammer/linux64/openocd-cfg-gen debugger.cfg`
9. Run juart-terminal (in the terminal where nios-shell is). The result of
running a simple *hello.c* program will later appear in it. It is important that
the FPGA is connected:
- `~/Quartus/qprogrammer/linux64/juart-terminal`
10. In RiscFree, configure the upload of code to Nios V:
- Right click on the project: *Run As* → *Run Configuartions* ...
11. Double click on GDB OpenOCD Debugging, a new configuration will open,
complete the first three tabs (*Main*, *Debugger*, *Startup*) similarly to the
following:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ebc99a-b828-4a1c-8cbd-7b8eed2cc674)

12. Enter the path to OpenOCD.
13. Add the generated cfg configuration file with the *-f* flag.
14. Add commands for GDB: *set arch riscv:rv32* and *set can-use-hw-watchpoints
0*:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e890f11d-4815-4b67-9ad1-5bb07593bf28)

15. Uncheck Arm semihosting option:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88fa213a-8e8a-4a6e-bb28-fadb4e90736d)

◦ Click *Apply* → *Run*
16. Do the same with the debugger
◦ Right click on the project: *Debug As* → *Debug Configuartions...*
17. Default code upload to Nios V (without using OpenOCD):
◦ Right click on the project: *Run As* → *Ashling RISC-V Hardware Debugging*.

On the first attempt, a window will open in which you need to go to the second
*Debugger* tab and set the *Target Configuration* by clicking the *Auto-detect
Scan Chain* option:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f221d30a-515a-4103-9cbe-e9dd9cf52221)

Click on *Apply* then *Run*.
