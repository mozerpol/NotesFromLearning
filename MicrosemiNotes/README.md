Firstly I'll decribe RTG4 from

In the introduction of pdf we can read about: <br>
1. *SerDes* - it's a Serializer/Deserializer (pronounced sir-deez or sir-dez),
a pair of functional blocks commonly used in high speed communications to
compensate for limited input/output. These blocks convert data between serial
data and parallel interfaces in each direction. <br/>

2. LEO - low Earth orbit (160 km - 1,600 km), MEO - medium Earth orbit (10,000 -
20,000 km), GEO (35,786 km above Earth) - geostationary or geosynchronous
orbit. Satellites do not operate between LEO and MEO because of the inhospitable
(pol. *nieprzyjazny*) environment for electronic components in that area, which
is caused by the
[Van Allen radiation belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt).

3. SEU - single-event upset - also known as a single-event error (SEE). It's a
type of error caused by the impact of a single ionizing particle (ions,
electrons, photons ...) into important part of micro-electronic device, such
as in a microprocessor. SEUs do not destroy the circuits involved, but they can
cause errors.
