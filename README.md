### How to run examples?
I'm using https://edaplayground.com/ website, I think if you want run examples from this repo, you should register on this website, it's free (at least on the day: 06.01.2021). On the screenshot you can see the main view after logging in.

On the left side you can select simulator. I'm using Verilog, so if you want run this examples, you should select from drop-down list in part *Tools & Simulators*: *Icarus Verilog 0.9.7*. Additionaly, if you want see waveforms, you must check *Open **EPWave** after run if not*, which is on the bottom *Tools & Simulators* part. <br/>

The left part of our window is for testbench, the right is for design. <br/>
In the bottom part you can add tile for project and description. After clicking *save*, you can see your project after clicking bookmark *Playgrounds* and *Your Playgrounds*: <br/>

Very important thing. If you want see waveforms you must add in testbench:
``` verilog
initial begin
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
    $dumpvars;
end
```
Of course in initial block you can add more code, but these lines are necessary to see vaweforms. Example waveform:

If you have more signals, but you don't see them on the waveform click *Get Signals* and select some.
