# NotesFromLearning

I'll post here notes, that I make while studying from various websites,
newspapers or books.

1. [Notes](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/Microprocessor-Design)
from reading the **Microprocessor Design** book, which is availble on the wiki: 
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/MicroprocessorDesign.pdf

2. [Notes](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/ExperimentsWithFPGA)
from reading the series of articles that appeared in the *Elektronika 
Praktyczna* magazine.

3. [Notes](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/main/FPGAodPoczatkuDoKonca) 
from reading the a series of two articles from the site *elektronikab2b*. It was
in my mother language.
[First](https://elektronikab2b.pl/technika/1315-fpga-od-poczatku-do-konca-czesc-pierwsza)
article, 
[second](https://elektronikab2b.pl/technika/1468-fpga-od-poczatku-do-konca-czesc-druga)
article. I wrote about it on 29.04.2021. The articles are named: 
"*FPGA od początku do końca - część pierwsza*" and "*FPGA od początku do końca 
część druga*".

4. [Notes](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/master/learningVerilog) 
from learning Verilog language. I will include notes from several books that 
helped me learn Verilog.
- The first is under 
[this](#http://www.ue.eti.pg.gda.pl/~bpa/jmis/skrypt_jmis_3v6.pdf) (date of 
access: 25.06.2021) address. It's created by my teacher Bogdan Pankiewicz, the 
title is "*SKRYPT DO PRZEDMIOTU Języki modelowania i symulacji*", it's written
in my mother language.
- The second is tutorial based on asic-world.com 
[website](#http://www.asic-world.com/verilog/veritut.html) created by Deepak 
Kumar Tala.
- The third is also written in my mother language, under 
[this](#http://staff.uz.zgora.pl/rwisniew/instrukcje/inne/verilog/verilog_kurs.pdf) 
(date of access: 25.06.2021) address. It's created by Jacek Bieganowski and 
Grzegorz Wawrzyniak, the title is "*Język Verilog w projektowaniu układów FPGA*".

5. [Notes](https://github.com/mozerpol/NotesFromLearning/tree/master/FPGAsForDummies)
from reading the book *FPGAs for dummies*, which is available for free on the
internet.
